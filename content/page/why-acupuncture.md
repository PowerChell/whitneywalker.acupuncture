# Frequently Asked Questions

**Does acupuncture really work for all these conditions?**  
Yes — acupuncture has been used for thousands of years and is supported by modern research for conditions like chronic pain, migraines, stress, and more. Every patient responds differently, and Whitney tailors treatment to your unique needs.

**How many sessions will I need?**  
The number of treatments varies depending on your condition, health history, and goals. Some patients notice improvement after just one session, while others benefit from a series of treatments over several weeks. Whitney will create a personalized plan during your initial session.

**Is acupuncture safe?**  
Absolutely. Acupuncture is very safe when performed by a licensed practitioner. Sterile, single-use needles are used to help towards creating a calming environment for your care.

**Does acupuncture hurt?**
Acupuncture uses very fine, sterile needles — much thinner than those used for injections or blood draws. Most patients feel little to no discomfort when the needles are inserted. Some experience a mild sensation of warmth, tingling, or heaviness, which is a normal sign that the body is responding. Depending on the treatment, you could be so relaxed that you fall asleep.
