Whitney Walker Acupuncture offers comprehensive Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments designed to address your specific health concerns and promote overall wellness. Each session is customized to your individual needs, drawing on a range of TCM practices.

## Treatment Techniques

During your session, Whitney may incorporate:

* **Acupuncture** – The use of fine, sterile needles at specific points to restore balance, reduce pain, and promote healing.  
* **Moxibustion** – Gentle warming therapy with dried mugwort to stimulate circulation and support the body’s natural healing.  
* **Cupping** – Suction therapy that relieves muscle tension, improves blood flow, and encourages relaxation.  
* **Gua Sha** – A light scraping technique that releases stagnation, eases tightness, and boosts immune function.  
* **Electrical Stimulation** – A gentle current applied to acupuncture needles to enhance pain relief, relaxation, and tissue healing, often for musculoskeletal concerns.  
* **Tui Na** – Hands-on therapeutic massage and acupressure to improve mobility and relieve discomfort.  
* **Auricular Therapy** – Targeting points on the ear to support whole-body health, including protocols for stress, addiction, and pain relief.  
* **Bloodletting (Micro-Bleeding)** – A gentle technique where a few drops of blood are released at specific points to improve circulation, reduce inflammation, and relieve pain.

All of these services are included as part of a standard acupuncture session. No extra charges apply—Whitney customizes the treatment based on your needs.
