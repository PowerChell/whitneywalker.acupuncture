Migraines can be debilitating — bringing intense pain, light sensitivity, nausea, and fatigue that disrupt daily life. If you’re searching for a natural migraine treatment in Boulder and Denver, CO, acupuncture may provide lasting relief without the side effects of medications.

Whitney Walker Acupuncture uses acupuncture to address migraines and headaches, helping patients reduce the frequency and intensity of their episodes while improving overall well-being.

## How Acupuncture Helps with Migraines

Acupuncture works by stimulating specific points on the body with very fine needles. This process encourages the release of endorphins, improves blood circulation, and balances the nervous system — all of which can help prevent and relieve migraine attacks.

Research has shown that acupuncture may:

* Reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks  
* Lessen associated symptoms like nausea and sensitivity to light/sound  
* Decrease reliance on migraine medications  
* Support overall stress reduction, which can be a common trigger
